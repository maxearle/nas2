"""This program can be used to manually filter data from the extractor based on the clustering of event properties in various 2D spaces. To use first run multi-filter.py which will start the GUI. Then using the dialogues at the top of the main window, select the HDF5 file containing your data (from extractor) and the props.pkl file (also from extractor), select the dataframe column containing event names and click 'lock in names'. From there you may use the drop down comboboxes in the bottom left to select properties to plot and 'update plot' can be clicked to action the changes. Points in the scatter plot can be clicked on to inspect their corresponding event on the right hand plot. When it's desired to remove points, a selection of mutliple points can be made using the split line select and lasso buttons in the middle bottom control panel. Once a selection is made, the selected points can be either removed or everything else can be removed using delete (d) and keep (k) in the bottom middle right respectively. Resetting the current selection can be done with the reset selection button in the bottom right panel or the remaining points can be saved to a dataframe with the 'save subset' button. This can be repeated until only desired events remain. If you want to analyse a new dataset, the 'new dataset' button in the top right allows you to reinitialise the program and start again with a different HDF5 or dataframe."""
